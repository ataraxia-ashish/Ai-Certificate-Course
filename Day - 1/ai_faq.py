if question=="What is ai??":
    print("AI, or Artificial Intelligence, is technology enabling computers and machines to simulate human intelligence")
elif question=="How does AI actually learn and work?":
    print("Artificial Intelligence (AI) learns and works primarily by using complex mathematical models and algorithms to identify patterns in vast amounts of data, allowing it to make decisions or generate new content without explicit, step-by-step programming for every specific outcome. This process is known as machine learning. ")
elif question=="What are the main types/branches of AI? ":
    print("The main branches of AI focus on different capabilities, with key areas including Machine Learning (ML) for learning from data, Natural Language Processing (NLP) for understanding human language, Computer Vision for interpreting images/video, Robotics for physical interaction, and Expert Systems for decision-making, alongside concepts like Deep Learning and Generative AI, all categorized by capability into Narrow (ANI), General (AGI), and Superintelligence (ASI). ")
elif question=="What are some real-world applications of AI?":
    print("Real-world AI applications are everywhere, powering personalized recommendations (Netflix, Amazon), digital assistants (Siri, Alexa), fraud detection in finance, drug discovery, autonomous vehicles, smart home devices, and healthcare diagnostics (cancer detection, disease prediction)")
elif question=="Will AI take all our jobs?":
    print("No, AI won't replace all jobs; instead, it's expected to transform most, automating routine tasks, creating new roles, and requiring significant upskilling, with jobs needing empathy, complex strategy, creativity, or physical dexterity being the most resilient. While some roles (data entry, basic support) face high automation risk, others (healthcare, skilled trades, leadership) are safer, highlighting a future of human-AI collaboration rather than total replacement. ")
elif question=="What are the biggest risks and ethical concerns?":
    print("The biggest risks and ethical concerns revolve around technology (AI bias, data privacy, job displacement), corporate conduct (discrimination, fraud, lack of transparency, corruption), and societal impact (misinformation, environmental damage, human rights), all leading to potential financial, legal, and reputational harm, requiring strong governance, training, and responsible innovation to manage")
elif question=="How can we ensure AI models are unbiased and fair?":
    print("Ensuring unbiased and fair AI involves a multi-faceted approach: using diverse, representative training data, implementing fairness-aware algorithms, conducting continuous auditing and monitoring, fostering interdisciplinary teams (including ethicists and affected communities), establishing strong governance, and incorporating transparency and accountability throughout the AI lifecycle")
elif question=="What is Generative AI, and what can it do?":
    print("Generative AI creates new content (text, images, code, audio, video) by learning patterns from existing data, revolutionizing industries by automating tasks, boosting creativity, and enabling personalization, with applications in chatbots, drug discovery, art, cybersecurity, finance (investment strategies, fraud detection), and marketing (personalized campaigns)")
elif question=="What's the future of AI?":
    print("The future of AI involves deeper integration into daily life, transforming industries like healthcare, finance, and creative arts with hyper-personalized experiences, powerful autonomous agents, and smarter robots, while also pushing towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) for human-level reasoning; ")
elif question=="What are the key programming languages & tools for AI?":
    print("Python dominates due to its simplicity and libraries (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn), but other key languages include Java (enterprise), C++ (performance), R (statistics), Julia (scientific computing), and JavaScript (web AI), while essential tools involve frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch), data tools (Pandas, NumPy), and specialized libraries like OpenCV for vision. ")
elif question=="What is Explainable AI (XAI)?":
    print("Explainable AI (XAI) refers to AI systems and techniques that allow humans to understand and trust the decisions and outputs of machine learning models, moving beyond simple predictions to show why a result was reached, enhancing transparency, fairness, and accountability, especially for complex black box models")
elif question=="What is the Turing Test?":
    print("The Turing Test, proposed by Alan Turing in 1950, is a test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from a human's, essentially asking if a computer can think like a person")
